# Auto-encoder-dimensionality-reduction
Using a simple linear  auto encoder to learn hidden representation of a 11 dimensional coffee data set in 5 dimensions
I recently scraped roughly 4GB of coffee shop data from Yelp and munged them with their location boundary data from Zillow.
Following this I combined the data into domain based features on which I performed PCA.I wanted to try and use an auto encoder instead
and use its hidden layer to project the feature matrix to 5 dimensions. This is an example of that
